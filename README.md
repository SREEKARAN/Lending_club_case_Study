## General Information

## Conclusions
- Below are few points can be considered  while approving a loan request.
- Loan Purpose: -Loans for debt consolidation are high risky , need thorough analysis of capacity of applicant before approving
- Loan Term: Loans with 60-month terms default  more than those with 36-month terms. Assess the borrower's ability to repay over the loan term.
- Interest Rate and Employment Length : interest rate with 13-17% and employment length with 10+ are more  likely to default
